#Project ICT 3

This repository was created for ICT project 3.

##Assignement
In this course we got the assignemnt to create a platform game.
There were only few requirements: 
- there had to be an introduction screen
- the game had to start on user interaction
- there had to be enemies wich can be defeated
- there had to be at least 2 levels  
- there needed a simple scoring

I created a low level version of commander Keen using the sdl.net library.

##Contents
In this repository you will find :
- my final report
- my final version of the code
- alternate idea's of how to implement certain things (most of them are not fully functional)
